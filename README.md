# ðŸš§ User Script Utils

These snippets can be used in user script managers that support ES modules.

- [Usage](#usage)
- [Development](#development)
  - [Adding new utils](#adding-new-utils)


## Usage

Scripts can be imported like this:

```js
import { addCss, delay, waitForElement, waitForElements } from 'https://esm.sh/gh/tinacious/user-script-utils@0.1.0'
```

See [docs](https://tinacious.github.io/user-script-utils/).


## Development

Install the dependencies:

    npm install

Run the dev server with file watcher:

    npm run dev

This will run the `index.html` file which supports hot reloading.

To test the static file, use a tool like [static-server](https://github.com/tinacious/static-server) to serve the root directory and open the `static.html` file.

The above-mentioned links are provided here for convenience with the default ports:

- http://localhost:29252 â€“ hot reloading
- http://localhost:29252/static.html - static


### Adding new utils

1. Create a new util
2. Export it as a named export
3. Add it to the `main.ts` barrel file so that it can be available from the root module
4. Add it to the `vite.config.js` file so that it can be available as its own module
5. Generate documentation by running `npm run typedoc`
